# Basic-Neural-Networks-CNN-with-MNIST

I have used MNIST dataset intinally to develop a basic Neural networks. The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.

In the .ipynb file you will see step by step process with comments how to develop a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit classification from scratch.
